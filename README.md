# Time Log

Time Log is a simple application for tracking time spent on projects

Projects: Areas of work-time you would like to track

* Click the New Project button to create a new one
* Click on the Project name to start a new timer and check total time spent

Potential problems:

* Doesn't accommodate time past midnight so won't work well for overnight projects
* Must stop your timers! If you did let a timer run too long, stop it and then edit time_used field on the timer

Thanks:

* Thanks to everyone in the [Google Tiddlywiki group][0]who have answered my questions. Especially:
  * Thomas Elmiger who's great RPN math plugin and [example code][1] got me most of the way.
  * TonyM and Mohammad for helping my sort through my New Timer button syntax.
